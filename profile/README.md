# Apex Legends Aim
The aimbots we provide for apex legends have two settings: Silent Aim and normal.
The normal mode is what you usually expect from an aimbot: Aiming at the head, neck, or other parts of the enemy.
The Silent Aim mode is good for streamers or people who want to stay safer.
It will make bullets hit if you aim close to the enemy, so you won't need to “Snap” onto their head. We believe this is a bit safer than the aim-locking as aim locking is easier to see during a manual review.
